- Fetch spec info from blizzard API for site usage
	- I have data stored in database currently, might be unnecessary
- Build blizzard API limiter/controller
- Clean up the code in the apply page. Split into components/functions
- Store HTML color codes for classes on database?
- Add specs the guild is recruiting (and admin ability to change)
- Add ability to change questions as an admin
- Fetch all data on site load for later use (possible solution is to store it on the
  database, and then it loads lightning quick on page load similar to applications page.
  Hint: look up node-schedule package and implement this)
	- Really important data needs to be stored in the global state for speedy loads
- Make site pretty
- Rewrite the site to use functions/modern React instead of classes
- Organize & structure site to be more legible/intuitive
- Make pages wait for load before display
- Fix issue with multiple calls/loads on each page
	- Seems to be fixed? Needs more testing
- Figure out why server is generating so much bloat text
- Separate the client and server into different projects
- Set up git and get VM to pull code from git
- Combine the api calls for Apply page into central area (no need for 2 spec info calls)
- Fix the website to work if application collection is empty. Crashes on empty currently
- Error checking on submit for Apply page. You can submit before the questions have been
  fetched currently. It's unlikely since all the questions need to be filled out before 
  submitting, but still possible.
	- Also check other Promise dependencies on the website.
- Time on the applications is showing up in the format "May 3, 2021 undefined:37 
  undefined"
- Change the hover color for the scrollbar to be a bit darker. Currently matches bg 
  color
- Verify that outside requests to the API server can't happen
- Make javascript files hidden/useless for the public site. They all show in source 
  currently
- Move the keys for auth0/Blizzard API into .env file
- Make site work on mobile
- Fix the active button color when not hovered (click the button twice and it's blue)
- Add bosses killed section
- Add Twitch streams
- Add kill videos
- Add a clean text box for Home, and About (match color from apply)
